          The 10-year STEP program will provide 20 wheelchairs, 20 educational
          laptops with assistive technology, and 20 walking canes annually. This
          project will build capacity for 400 leaders of Persons Living with
          Disabilities (PLWD) in Nigeria; with the purpose for providing
          platforms for self-determination, equity, inclusion, diversity, and
          catalysts for economic integration.

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Nearly 9.1 million young adults in Nigeria are out of school due to
          poverty. Persons Living with Disabilities (PLWD) form 25% of this
          population. Ellen Thompson, a Nigerian and paraplegic activist for
          more than 30 years, and the Founder and President of Center for the
          Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities (CAPWD) has been advocating for
          the rights of the PLWD in Nigeria. She succinctly stated,
          “Adolescents/young adults need education, no PLWD all over the world
          wants to beg! We want to create
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The STEP’s 10-year 400 PLWD leadership plan provides 20 wheelchairs,
          20 laptops with assistive technology, and 20 walking canes annually to
          empower 40 PLWD young adults. This will prepare them to disengage from
          system-dependence to self-dependence in their daily struggles and
          integrate them into productive members of society. Education is a
          proven way to empower self-determination, gain equality, inclusion,
          and diversity for fundamental human rights and dignity.
        </p>
        <h3>Long-Term Impact</h3>
        <p>
          In partnership with the Center for Advocacy for Persons with
          Disabilities (CAPWD) and the Knowledge for the Blind Initiative
          (KFBI), the 10- year investment strategy is to build determined 400
          PLWD from among the young adults through education and leadership
          training platforms. The project hopes to become a threshold for
          enabling PLWD community to rise above poverty, gain self- dependent
          mindset, and thus bring sustainable empowerment in a world hungry for
          equal rights, diversity, and inclusion
