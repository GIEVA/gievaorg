        History of GIEVA
      </h2>
      <p>
        The dream all began in 2001. The Global Integrated Education Volunteers
        Association was registered as Incorporated Trustees August 2006.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Daniel and Ruth Obaka founded and incorporated the Global Integrated
        Education Volunteers Association as a not-for-profit organization in
        Nigeria. It is with a vision for building a system that provides global
        platforms for young African leaders and entrepreneurs to achieve
        potential through educational services/programs, training to be free
        from system dependence and to become self-dependent.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In their quest for realizing their dream they mobilized 16 (Sixteen)
        pioneer professionals/experts in education, health, environment, youth,
        social works, information & communication technology, legal, and
        management team to register the Association as a non-governmental
        organization (NGO), Nigeria
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Daniel and Ruth were motivated by the history of their lives to
        establish the organizations. Daniel Newton Obaka was born into a very
        poor family and his wife Ruth Obaka into a Muslim royal family. Daniel
        lost his father at the age of six. His mother, though illiterate and
        extremely poor, recognized the value of education and was not deterred
        by the immediate economic and social conditions and hardship. She
        sacrificed and provided the needed education for her son.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        On the other hand, Ruth Obaka as a girl-child from a royal family with
        personal self-determination, overcame the obstacles that faced the
        girl-child education at that time and became a motivating factor and
        hope for other girls to access education and to obtain freedom from the
        manipulative “culture of male domination”.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Their recorded “educational timelines” impassioned them to establish the
        GIEVA organization, a vehicle to enable them “give back to society”.
        With the ability to identify and inspire young men and women with the
        same backgrounds, Daniel and Ruth lead young African leaders to take a
        cause greater than self.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Recognizing the evolving globalization and education as key for
        constructive engagement, Daniel and Ruth extended their passion to
        inspire young generations of African leaders to imbibe quality,
        integrity, and community spirit for public good. They are proud to see
        the Global Integrated Education Volunteers Association – a
        non-governmental/non-profit organization in Nigeria and the United
        States respectively evolve into a system that creates a shared –
        ownership mindset and develops shared – entrepreneurial and innovation
        values among the youth through education and networking.{" "}
